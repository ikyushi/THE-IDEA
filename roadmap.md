# roadmap

basically, here's a list of everything i ***WANT*** the game to have:

* music (and sound effects)
* actually nice graphics
* a decent story
* renpy integration for the story (vn homage, of course)
* differentiations between each character (i.e. different skins)
* maybe a plus version BUT THAT'S AFTER THE ORIGINAL GAME IS FINISHED AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

here's a list of everything i ***DO NOT WANT*** the game to have:

* too many flashing lights
* too many sounds
* online multiplayer: while i don't like the idea of multiple people playing on the same savefile, as that would create unnecessary coding, i *do* like the idea of having one person playing at a time, and other people surrounding the player and their game, watching. i would, however, be able to entertain that idea provided that the controls support two characters (basically twoplayer, but one keyboard (or multiple keyboards))
* it to be able to be played on a mobile device (i.e. a phone)

lastly, here's a list of things that the game ***NEEDS*** to have:

* a basic gui (menus, inventory, etc)
* a save file

that's it, really. i know this isn't a traditional roadmap, but it is going to function as one.
