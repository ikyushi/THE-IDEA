# THE IDEA

*But it was ***the idea*** that counts.*

A one-player two-player game.

"really, it's just a break from the [rhythm game madness](https://twitch.tv/simplesentai), as well as an idea that was (somewhat) inspired by [this website](https://letsmakeagame.net/). it's also an excuse for me to learn pygame (笑笑笑)" -me, because i don't have any friends :(
