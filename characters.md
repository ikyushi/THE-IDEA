# Meet the characters!

In this file, you can meet all of the characters in the game and learn some stuff about them!

## Amaya

"Hi! I'm Amaya! I'm Rikai-san's sister, and I'm really good at playing chess!"

Amaya is a very shy character, so she's not very popular. Despite that, when you find something she loves to talk about, she'll talk for ***hours*** about it! Like she said, she's also Rikai-san's sister, and they both get along really well. However, Yuri-san and Amaya-san don't always get along well, so you'll have to be careful when you talk to them about each other.

## Rikai

"Hey. My name's Rikai. I'm Amaya-sama's twin sister. I love talking to people, and everyone seems to be my friend!"

Unlike Amaya, Rikai is very outgoing, and everyone seems to enjoy her company. She can, however, be a little shy at times, but only when she's bored or uninterested in the conversation. She's best friends with Yuri-san, and you'll have a great time learning about her in-game and becoming one of her best friends!
